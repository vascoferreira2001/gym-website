Final Project
Title: Responsive Website development in Booststrap with access to database tables
Objectives:
This activity is intended to aggregate the different subjects taught in this UC in order to
provide students with a global vision of the Web development environment.
At the end of this work, students should be able to practice the basic components of the
elaboration of a website recurring to bootstrap framework. In addition, students should
be able to create access to a database to store and retrieve information.
Students must acquire basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP technologies.
Description:
The theme is free. Each group can define the theme you want as long as it respects the
minimum requirements listed below. It is intended to develop a website that provides
responsive navigation through information related to activities regarding the chosen
theme. Use the bootstrap framework to accelerate development.
Minimum requirements:
•

All pages should be responsive and have a responsive menu of options (at the
very least, these options should exist):

•

The homepage should be composed by (at least) the following elements:
o

where you will be asked for the name, email address and the question to ask.

When you select the "Admin" option, you should access a new menu that allows
you to insert a new record and list products, services, bookings, etc. (whatever
makes sense for the site).

•

You can create as many tables as you need to make sense of your site, however,
one of these tables (products, services, bookings, etc.) must have a number and
types of fields approximately identical to the form below (booking form).

•

The "Submit" option should allow records to be inserted into database tables
using the appropriate form.

•

The “List rents” option should have the option to edit (for changes via a form)
and remove at the end of the record. The remove option should allow the entire
record to be shown in a form with disabled fields and 2 buttons (one for
"continue" and delete, and a second button for cancel).
